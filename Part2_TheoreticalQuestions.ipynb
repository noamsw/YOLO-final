    "(*): In a multi-GPU training each GPU is associated with its own process that holds an independent copy of the model. In each training iteration a (large) batch is split among these processes (GPUs) which compute the gradients of the loss w.r.t the relevant split of the data. Afterwards, the gradients from each process are then shared and averaged so that the GD would take into account the correct gradient and to assure synchornization of the model copies. Note that the proccesses are blocked between training iterations."
